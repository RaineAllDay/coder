Usage: coder delete <workspace>

Delete a workspace

Options
    --orphan (default: false) 
        Delete a workspace without deleting its resources. This can delete a
        workspace in a broken state, but may also lead to unaccounted cloud
        resources.

    --yes, -y
        Bypass prompts.
